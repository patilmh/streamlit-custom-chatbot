[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://app-custom-chatbot.streamlit.app/)

This custom chatbot app with memory is created using Streamlit, Python and uses gpt-3.5-turbo model. 

The chatbot remembers the context of the conversation. If you ask 'What is the capital of California' and then ask 'And what is it's population', the chatbot knows you are asking about the population of Sacramento.

The chatbot allows you to set the role for the bot from the sidebar. This is an optional feature as the default role has already been set for the chatbot. You can change the role from the default 'You are an AI assistant' to something like 'Please answer in Spanish'.
